Certain features of Chroma and its extension mods require you to agree to a safety warning.  Both the reasoning behind this, and the instructions to do so, are below.

If you are planning to enable these features, it is imperative to know you are doing so
<align="center"><color="red">AT YOUR OWN RISK</color></align>

Below are the features explicitly blocked unless the safety waiver has been signed.  Not all of these features around in Chroma - some are part of an extension plugin.

<b>Nightmare</b>
<i>Requires ChromaToggle</i>
-<indent=3>Nightmare involves flashing lights, and static lights cannot prevent them.</indent>
-<indent=3>Therefore, this serves as your epilepsy warning.</indent>
-<indent=3>  There.  You are warned.</indent>
-<indent=3>Do not play Nightmare if you have epilepsy.</indent>
-<indent=3>Side note: Nightmare is extremely difficult.</indent>

<b>Technicolour Mayhem features</b>
-<indent=3>These maps are visually and chromatically over-intense, and may have epilepsy issues.</indent>
-<indent=3>While static lights can prevent these, better to be safe than sorry, right?</indent>

<b>Insanity</b>
<i>Requires ChromaToggle</i>
-<indent=3>This feature name is based on how immensely disorienting and absurd it is.</indent>
-<indent=3>Even seasoned VR players can experience nausea or dizziness from this mode.</indent>
-<indent=3>Do not play this mode with a small play space.</indent>

<b>Head Sabers<b>
<i>Requires ChromaToggle</i>
-<indent=3>Also known as Unicorn Mode.  This one should be obvious.</indent>
-<indent=3>YOU MAY BREAK YOUR NECK.  DO NOT BREAK YOUR NECK.</indent>
-<indent=3>I AM NOT LIABLE FOR NECK INJURIES.  OR ANY OTHER INJURIES!</indent>
-<indent=3>Seriously, though, head sabers can hurt you - badly.</indent>
-<indent=3>Stretch well beforehand, and do not play more than a couple</indent>
-<indent=3>minutes at a time.  Don't be as dumb as I am.</indent>

Good luck.
