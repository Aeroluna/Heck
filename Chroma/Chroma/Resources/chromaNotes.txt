%GREETING%

Here at the luxurious suite of Chroma we value your eye-cone-thingies.

A recent trend of duochromitis has plagued the VR community since the release of a particularly popular music game I can't remember the name of right now, but the important thing is Chroma is here to slap some spectrum back in your drab two-tone lives.

Embrace a cacophony of Technicolour lightwaves, or if you want to paint it all black you can do that too!  With Chroma, there's over <color=#005500>1.844674e+163</color> possible combinations!  Think we made that number up?  Good, because we did!  There's too many to count!

If instead of fighting back the neverending onslaught of aggressive cubes, you're one of those... <i>creative...</i> types, Chroma has something for you too!  Or if you're just one to appreciate any fine craft, you too should find some solace in the fact that Chroma offers mappers the ability to manually map in full <color="red">R</color><color="green">G</color><color=#00bfff>B</color> colour!  That's right, your dreams of dancing along to Barbie Girl engulfed in hot pink and cherry red strobing lights are that much closer to reality!  <i>You're welcome!</i>

And of course, all colours can be customized.  We didn't forget those of you who can't appreciate all sixteen million colours.  It's a rough life you live, and Chroma wants only to make things better.  Chroma is your friend.  Chroma loves you.  Chroma never wants you to le-
