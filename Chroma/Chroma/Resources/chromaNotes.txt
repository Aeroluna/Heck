Welcome, %USERNAME%!  

Here at the luxurious suite of Chroma™ we value your eye-cone-thingies.

A recent trend of duochromitis has plagued the VR community since the release of a particularly popular music game I can't remember the name of right now, but the important thing is Chroma is here to slap some spectrum back in your drab two-tone lives.

Embrace a cacophony of Technicolour© lightwaves, or if you want to paint it all black you can do that too!  With Chroma, there's over <color=#005500>1.844674e+163</color> possible combinations!  Think we made that number up?  Good, because we did!  There's too many to count!

And of course, all colours can be customized.  We didn't forget those of you who can't appreciate all sixteen million colours.  It's a rough life you live, and Chroma wants only to make things better.  Chroma is your friend.  Chroma loves you.  Chroma never wants you to le-
