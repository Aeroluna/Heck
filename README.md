 These mods are all about giving the mapper more power to make amazing maps! These features range from moving walls around mid-flight, creating fake notes, and even coloring bombs, all on a pre-programmed path. Together these mods can be installed by a user and will activate on a map that requires these mods. Combining these mods in one map culminates into something called a [modhcart](https://youtu.be/5xA3iR5v-Rk) (C18H27NO3 - Mapped by Mawntee).

## Documentation
For any mappers interested in using any of these mods, please visit the wiki at https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki

The wiki is NOT a tutorial for mapping, json editting, or scripting. Instead, it lists all the features within all of the mods and their respective syntax.

## Capabilities
### Heck
- Having undescriptive description.
- Handle tracks and track animation events.
- Allows mods to dynamically patch and unpatch their Harmony patches.
- Adds `_settings` field which allows mappers to recommend certain settings/modifiers.
- Any other shared code between these mods below

### NoodleExtensions
This adds a host of new things you can do with your maps with a focus on manipulating the transforms of notes and walls.

MAPPERS: EITHER USE MAPPING EXTENSIONS OR NOODLE EXTENSIONS, DO NOT USE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. Noodle Extensions is meant to completely replace Mapping Extensions, as they both do the same thing. Having both requirements can break some features.

NOODLE EXTENSIONS WILL NOT READ MAPS THAT USE MAPPING EXTENSIONS. YOU HAVE TO INSTALL MAPPING EXTENSIONS FOR THOSE. (You can have both of the mods installed at once)

### Chroma
Chromaâ„¢ boasts the most power in color customization you've ever seen, allowing mappers to customize blocks, lights, sabers, and barriers into not just one but multiple colors! Also contains an API that lets other mods color these things as well. (See [Technicolor](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Technicolor))

## Getting Help
Found a bug? Please report it! The worst thing you can do is discover a bug and silently grumble about it to yourself. I can only fix bugs that I know about.

Reporting a bug? Please Do not DM me on discord! Open an issue in the issue tracker. This makes it far easier to keep track of your bug and if you DM me, I'll probably forget (opening an issue pings me on discord anyways). Need to contact me for any other reason? Reach me at Aeroluna#0001
